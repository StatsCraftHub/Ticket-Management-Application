# Ticket-Management-Application
A ticket management application built using R Shiny is a dynamic and user-friendly tool designed to streamline the process of handling and tracking support requests, issues, or tickets within an organization.
This Shiny app, titled "Ticket Management," offers a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing tickets within the industry. It is designed to streamline the process of creating, monitoring, and analyzing tickets related to various tasks and issues. Here are some key features and details about this project:

User-Friendly Interface: The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface through a Shiny dashboard. Users can easily navigate through different functionalities.

Create New Tickets: Users can create new tickets by providing essential information such as the ticket title, description, status (Open, In Progress, Closed), the assigned person, and the start and end dates. This feature allows for efficient logging of issues or tasks.

Ticket Tracking: The app maintains an in-memory database of tickets, storing details such as the Ticket ID, Title, Description, Status, Assigned To, Start Date, End Date, and Time Taken. This tracking system ensures a comprehensive record of all tasks and their progress.

Data Visualization: One of the highlights of this project is its data visualization capabilities. It includes a dynamic and interactive bar chart generated using Plotly, displaying the summary of ticket statuses in the last three months. This chart offers valuable insights into ticket trends, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

Data Table: The app also presents a data table using the DataTables package, allowing users to view and interact with the entire ticket database. This table is paginated for convenience and can display a specified number of entries per page.

Efficient Data Entry: The app ensures efficient data entry by resetting input fields after creating a new ticket. This feature saves time and prevents redundancy.

Date Calculations: It calculates the time taken for each ticket by computing the difference between the start and end dates. This metric aids in tracking task completion times.

Date Filters: The app includes a date filter to focus on tickets created within the last three months. This filter enhances data analysis and helps users identify recent trends and patterns.

Practical Application: This project is ideal for companies or departments that need a digital solution for managing tasks, tracking ticket statuses, and gaining insights into their workflow efficiency.

Continuous Improvement: The app can be further enhanced by adding user authentication, additional data analytics features, and the ability to export data for reporting purposes, making it an even more valuable tool for ticket management.
